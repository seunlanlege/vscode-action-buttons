# VsCode Action Buttons

## Features

* Execute command in terminal

    * Any command that can be activated via a keyboard shortcut can be activated via a button
* Ability to customize text color for each button

## Installation and setup

 - [x] Install the `VsCode Action Buttons` extension in your VS Code instance.
 - [x] After installing, open your VS Code settings (`Ctrl + ,`). Navigate to the `VsCode Action Buttons` section.
 - [x] Define the action buttons you want. Below is a sample configuration for reference.
 - [x] Reload the VS Code window to see the new buttons. Alternatively, you can run the `Refresh Action Buttons` command to refresh without reloading the window.

 ```json
 	"actionButtons": {
		 "defaultColor": "#ff0034", // Can also use string color names.
		 "loadNpmCommands":false, // Disables automatic generation of actions for npm commands.
		 "reloadButton":"‚ôªÔ∏è", // Custom reload button text or icon (default ‚Üª). null value enables automatic reload on configuration change
		 "commands": [
			 {
				 "cwd": "/home/custom_folder", 	// Terminal initial folder ${workspaceFolder} and os user home as defaults
				 "name": "Run Cargo",
				 "color": "green",
				 "singleInstance": true,
				 "command": "cargo run ${file}", // This is executed in the terminal.
			 },
